# Event Host Guidelines
Are you considering hosting a an event with one of our instructors on your server? We're excited to collaborate with you! To ensure that your event is a success, based on our experience running online instruction events, we've put together a suggested checklist of tasks that will help you organize and run your event seamlessly.

Our checklist covers all the important aspects of hosting a live instruction event, from briefing your guests on our backgrounds to preparing a contingency plan for potential issues. We recommend that you review these guidelines carefully to minimize potential issues and ensure a smooth, engaging event for all participants.

In addition to our comprehensive checklist, we also provide branding and graphic assets to help you promote your event and make it stand out. We'll provide you with everything you need to create an eye-catching online presence that will attract attendees from far and wide.

And after your event, our post-event follow-up checklist will help you gather feedback from your attendees, share event recordings and summaries, and easy to follow-up tasks for everyone who participated.

So, if you're considering hosting a Dose of Data event on your server, keep these guidelines in mind to make your event a success. We're excited to collaborate with you and bring the magic of data to your community!
